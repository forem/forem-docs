# Containers

**Installing Forem using Containers**

If you encounter any errors with our Container setup, please kindly
[report any issues](https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/new/choose)!

## Installing prerequisites

_These prerequisites assume you're working on an operating system supported by
Docker or Podman._

### Choosing a Container Engine

A container engine is software that runs and manages containers on a computer.
One of the most widely known Container Engines is Docker, but there are many
other Container Engines available, such as [Podman](https://podman.io/),
[CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/), and
[LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/).

Forem supports two Container Engines: Docker and Podman.

### Docker

Forem can be setup with Docker and Docker Compose on macOS or Linux systems.

Docker is available for many different operating systems. You may use Docker as
your Container Engine on both macOS and Linux workstations. As of right now
Docker is the only Container Engine for macOS and we recommend you follow the
[Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/),
install instructions to get Docker and Docker Compose installed.

Docker also works well on Linux distributions that have not moved to cgroup v2.
You can install it by following their
[Installation per distro](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to get Docker
and you can install Docker Compose by following these
[instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Podman

Forem can be setup with Podman and Podman Compose on Linux systems.

[Podman](https://podman.io/) is an FOSS project that provides a Container Engine
that is daemonless which only runs on Linux systems. It can be run as the root
user or as a non-privileged user. It also provides a Docker-compatible command
line interface. Podman is available on many different Linux distributions and it
can be installed by following these
[instructions](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation).

[Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose) is a an early
project under development that is implementing docker-compose like experience
with Podman. You can install it by following these
[instructions](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose#installation).

## Setting up Forem

1.  Fork Forem's repository, e.g. <https://github.com/forem/forem/fork>
1.  Clone your forked repository, eg.
    `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/forem.git`
1.  Set up your environment variables/secrets

    1.  Create `.env` by copying from the provided template`.env_sample` (i.e.
        with bash: `cp .env_sample .env`).

        - `.env` is a personal file that is **ignored in git**.
        - `.env` lists all the `ENV` variables we use and provides a fake
          default for any missing keys.

    2.  For any key that you wish to enter/replace:

        - You do not need "real" keys for basic development. Some features
          require certain keys, so you may be able to add them as you go.
		  The test environment is isolated from changes to the .env file, if
		  you want to set variables in both test and development, use a file
		  named .env.local, or modify .env.test.local and .env.development.local.
        - The [backend guide](../../backend/configuration) will show you how to get free API keys
          for additional services that may be required to run certain parts of
          the app.
        - Obtain the development variable and apply the key you wish to
          enter/replace. i.e.:

        ```shell
        export CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="SOME_REAL_SECURE_KEY_HERE"
        export CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="ANOTHER_REAL_SECURE_KEY_HERE"
        export CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="A_CLOUDINARY_NAME"
        ```

## Running Forem with Docker via docker-compose

1. Run `bin/container-setup`
2. That's it! Navigate to <http://localhost:3000>

The script executes the following steps:

1. `docker-compose build`
2. `docker-compose up`

## Running Forem with Podman via podman-compose

1. Run `bin/container-setup`
2. That's it! Navigate to <http://localhost:3000>

The script executes the following steps:

1. `podman-compose build`
2. `podman-compose up`

## Known Problems & Solutions

### Docker on Mac

- In case `rails server` starts with the following message:

  ```shell
  Data update scripts need to be run before you can start the application. Please run rails data_updates:run (RuntimeError)
  ```

  run the following command:

  ```shell
  docker-compose run rails bundle exec rails data_updates:run
  ```
