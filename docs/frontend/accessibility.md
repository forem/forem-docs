Weâ€™re currently making rapid changes to the product so our docs may be out of date. If you need help, please email [yo@forem.com](mailto:yo@forem.com).

To make Forem the most inclusive community platform around, accessibility should
be considered to enable people with disabilities to create and consume content.

## The Basics

Forem UI changes should consider accessibility wherever possible. Common issues
to watch out for in frontend code:

- [Adequate color contrast](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/evaluating)
- [Semantic structure and headings](https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/)
- [Alternative text for images](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/)
- [Unique button and link text](https://webaim.org/techniques/hypertext/link_text)
- [Accessible forms with labels](https://webaim.org/techniques/forms/)
- [Visible keyboard focus styles](https://www.washington.edu/accessibility/checklist/focus/)

## More Advanced Things

If you're working on something JavaScript-heavy or animated, there are a few
additional considerations for accessibility:
