# Initializers & the asset pipeline

:::important

When refactoring or adding new functionality that lives in the asset pipeline, strongly consider moving it to Packs and Webpacker.

:::

Initializers reside in Pack files and Webpacker. See [Pack Files & Webpacker](/frontend/javascript-approaches/packs#initializers-in-webpacker) for more information.
